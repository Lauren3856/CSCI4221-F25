## My Role
My name is Lauren Flournoy. My role in the project is that i am the UI/UX Designer. I am responsible for the design layout of the app, as well as visuals and creative elements for the app. While doing this i also will keep project notes, and updating and communicating wih my group. Our project is a universal scanner app that allows users to scan barcodes from major retail stores across Canada and the U.S. After sacanning, the app provides detailed information instantly. By combining this functionality into one platform, it removes the need for customers to download multiple store-specific apps, making shopping more efficient and convenient.
